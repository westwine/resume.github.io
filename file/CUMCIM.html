        		<h1>Mathematical modeling contest</h1>
				<p>I have attend <em>China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling</em> in 2018. I had been preparing for that from 04.01.2018 to 09.13.2018, during which time, I was constantly
                working on constructing a math model of real world problem and making analysis according to the model using matlab and python. After the contest, I had finished 8 essays covering  different topics and problems such as 
                CT scanner analysis, chinese population prediction, design of heat-protection suit, wind power plant, the trajectory of missile and so on. I have acquired the skills of doing scientfic research and writing academic essays in the intensive training and practice.
                To be more specific, I am familiar with the process of facing tough problems, searching background information and doing research, expressing the problem using math, making analysis through advanced math, optimizing my ideas and solutions and expressing myself trough academic 
                writing and speech. This experience helps me cultivate my research skills.
