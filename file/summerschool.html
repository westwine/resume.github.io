        		<h1>RWTH Aachen University Summer School in "Robotics for Future Industrial Application</h1>
				<p>I am a participant of the summer school at RWTH at 2019. The lecture covers the topics of 
                industry 4.0, communication networks and interfaces, automation system, lloT, motion planning with ROS,
                robot learning and robot simulation. Besides lectures, we also have practical units when we implement our 
                knowledge. I get to see robotics in a modern view and understand its potential. What is more, I have been introduced
                to many softwares and frameworks used in robotics which I will dive in later in my carrer.
