        		<h1>Robocup</h1>
				<p>I am a member of Robocup club in our school since 09.01.2018 We mainly focus on designing dancing robots and humanoid racing robots. 
                I finally encounterd the love of my life, robotics. From weekly meeting and hands-on practice, I master the skills of designing mechanical
                system using solidworks, 'sort of' optimizing topology using ansys and manufacturing components using 3D print and other forming method.
                 I also gained knowledge of MCU to control the robot to dance. This is the introduction of robotics for me and I will expand myself in this feild.
