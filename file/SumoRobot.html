        		<h1>Sumo Robot</h1>
				<p>I have been working on this project from 04.01.2019. The goal is to design a sumo robot that can
                beat other opponents on stage. Any task that has strict performance requirements is difficult. In the process of 
                designing its structure and electronic system, I am aware of what it takes to bulid a sophisticated robot system. Errors and
                mental break down can happpen at any time and I need to proceed anyhow because tortured path is a must. Despite many setbacks, the
                results seem to be fruitful. I am familiar with arduino and stm32, begin to form the concept of the application and limitation of robotics by 
                experimenting with various sensors and algorithm and gained a strong mindset. This is the first comprehensive robot system I built.
